   This program is designed to help guide a user through the SQ3R reading and note-taking process while taking notes on a text. It was built by Tiana Cook, Jake Follett, Cristian Ion, Wanrong Qi, and Jack White in April 2022 for CIS422 class project 1 at the University of Oregon. 

   To initialize and run the program, please see the Installation_Instructions.pdf file. The users will need Python 3.10 and MySQL. 8.0.0 (or newer) for compiling the ARA program. There are two main source code files for running this program: main.py and ARA.py. The main.py file is for the system administrator to run in the terminal or command line to view the contents of the database. The ARA.py is for students to run the program and start note-taking. For more information on how to use the program, please see the User_Documentation.pdf file. If students have problems while using the program, they should contact their system administrator.
